# nodecg-graphic-previewer

nodecg-graphic-previewer is a [NodeCG](http://github.com/nodecg/nodecg) bundle.
It works with NodeCG versions which satisfy this [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning) range: `^2.0.0`
You will need to have an appropriate version of NodeCG installed to use it.


## Developing

Use the following commands:

-   `npm run build`: Build the project once.
-   `npm run watch`: Build the project and automatically rebuild on changes.
-   `npm run dev`: Build the project, automatically rebuild on changes, launch the NodeCG server, and automatically restart the NodeCG server on changes.
    -   Only restarts the NodeCG server when server-side (i.e. extension) code changes. Changes to client-side code (i.e. dashboard panels and graphics) will not cause the server to restart, nor will they cause browser tabs to automatically refresh.
